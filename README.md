# ShellHist
Inspired from https://github.com/bamos/zsh-history-analysis.

Visualize your usage of Bash/Zsh through a web app thanks
to Flask and Highcharts.

**Alpha stage! Actual history is not used (only fixtures right now).**

## Dependencies
Only Flask: `pip install flask`. You will also need Internet connection since
assets are not bundled.

## Installation
Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Pawamoy/shellhist`.

ShellHist needs a lot of info to be able to display various charts. The basic
shell history is not enough. In order to generate the necessary information,
you have to source the `shellhist.sh` script.

It will append your commands in a second file in your home:
`.shell_history_extended`.

**Your shell history configuration will not be modified.**

Only two things will be modified in your shell environment:
- your `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable for Bash, or your `precmd` function for Zsh,
- the trap on `DEBUG` signal.

So, at shell startup, in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, put a line like the following:

```bash
# make sure nothing is prepended to PROMPT_COMMAND or precmd after this line
. '/path/to/shellhist/shellhist.sh'
```

... and now use your shell normally!

## Usage
Simply `./run.sh`, or run it manually with `FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`.
Now go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and enjoy!

## History file format
Fields saved along commands are start and stop timestamps, hostname, username,
uuid (generated), tty, process' parents, shell, shell level, return code, and
working directory (path), in the following format:
`:start:stop:uuid:parents:host:user:tty:path:shell:level:code:command`.

- multiline commands are prepended with a semi-colon `;` instead of a colon `:`,
  starting at second line
- start and stop timestamps are in microseconds since epoch
- process' parents and working directory are encoded in base64 to avoid
  delimiter corruption

Example (multiline command):

```
:1510588139930150:1510588139936608:40701d9b-1807-4a3e-994b-dde68692aa14:L2Jpbi9iYXNoCi91c3IvYmluL3B5dGhvbiAvdXNyL2Jpbi94LXRlcm1pbmFsLWVtdWxhdG9yCi91c3IvYmluL29wZW5ib3ggLS1zdGFydHVwIC91c3IvbGliL3g4Nl82NC1saW51eC1nbnUvb3BlbmJveC1hdXRvc3RhcnQgT1BFTkJPWApsaWdodGRtIC0tc2Vzc2lvbi1jaGlsZCAxMiAyMQovdXNyL3NiaW4vbGlnaHRkbQovc2Jpbi9pbml0Cg==:myhost:pawamoy:/dev/pts/1:L21lZGlhL3Bhd2Ftb3kvRGF0YS9naXQvc2hlbGxoaXN0Cg==:/bin/bash:1:0:echo 'a
;b
;c' | wc -c
```

## How it works
In order to append a line each time a command is entered, the `PROMPT_COMMAND`
variable and the `precmd` function are used, respectively for Bash and Zsh.
They allow us to execute arbitrary instructions just before the command prompt
is displayed, meaning, just after the last command has returned.

This is where we compute the stop time, return code and working directory,
and append the line into our history file.

Values for UUID, parents, hostname, and TTY are computed only once, when
`shellhist.sh` is sourced. Indeed they do not change during usage of the current
shell process. Hostname and TTY are obtained through commands `$(hostname)` and
`$(tty)`. UUID is generated with command `$(uuidgen)`. Also note that UUID
is exported in subshells so we know which shell is a subprocess of another, and
so we are able to group shell processes by "sessions", a session being an opened
terminal (be it a tab, window, pane or else). Parents are obtained with a
function that iteratively greps `ps` result with PIDs (see `shellhist.sh`).

Values for user, shell and level are simply obtained through environment
variables: `$USER`, `$SHELL`, and `$SHLVL`.

Start time is computed just before the entered command is run by the shell,
thanks to a trap on the DEBUG signal. From Bash manual about `trap`:

>If a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple command.

The last command is obtained with the command `fc`. It will feel like your
history configuration is mimic'd by the extended history. If the commands
beginning with a space are ignored, `shellhist` will notice it and will not
append these commands. Same for ignored duplicates. If you enter an empty line,
or hit Control-C before enter, nothing will be appended either. The trick behind
this is to check the command number in the current history (see `shellhist.sh`
for technical details). Note however that if you type the same command in an
other terminal, it will still be appended, unless you manage to synchronize your
history between terminals.
